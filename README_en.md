## 📜 Technologies

The Weather App was built with ReactJS, allowing users to search for weather forecast information for different cities around the world. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather information. My favorite aspect is that the background dynamically adjusts according to user search terms, creating a personalized visual experience. Additionally, the website displays the user's local time to complement the weather forecasts, and presents the relevant information in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.
